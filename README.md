## 📦 Dependencies

Install these using `npm`:

```bash
npm install express cors nodemailer
```

> `path` is also used in the backend but is built-in to Node.js and does not need installation.

---

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gvmc-light-report-prototype
   ```

   Or download the ZIP and extract it.

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install express cors nodemailer
   ```

3. **Configure email notifications:**

   Open `server.js` and update the following:

   ```js
   const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
     service: 'Gmail', // or 'SendGrid', etc.
     auth: {
       user: 'your_email@gmail.com',
       pass: 'your_email_password_or_app_password'
     }
   });

   const mailOptions = {
     from: 'your_email@gmail.com',
     to: 'recipient_email@example.com',
     subject: `New Street Light Report - Reference ID: ${referenceId}`,
     ...
   };
   ```

   ⚠️ For Gmail, use an App Password if 2FA is enabled. Do **not** use your main email password.

## ▶️ Running the Application

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
Server listening on http://localhost:3008
Backend is running. Access the application through your browser.
```

Open [http://localhost:3008](http://localhost:3008) in your browser.

---

## 🧪 Submitting a Report

1. Go to `/report.html`.
2. Fill in the form details.
3. Use "Use Current Location" or enter the address manually.
4. Click "Submit Report".
5. A confirmation message and reference ID will appear.

Reports are logged to the backend console and emailed to the configured recipient.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Disclaimers

- ❌ **No database**: Data is **not stored** persistently.
- 🔐 **Security**: No authentication, authorization, or input sanitization.
- 🌍 **CDN Dependence**: UI depends on external CDNs (Bootstrap, Leaflet, Font Awesome).
- 📸 **File Upload**: Photo upload input is disabled.
- 🛑 **Check Status**: The "Check Status" feature is **non-functional (N/A)**.
- 📬 **External API reliance**: Geolocation, reverse geocoding, and email depend on 3rd-party services.
- 🧪 **Prototype only**: Not suitable for production use.
